# TLS Capture Tool - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Port Filtering Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The "-P" option was not taking effect, and traffic was being captured from/to every port.

**Analysis**: 
- The port filtering was actually working correctly in the BPF program
- The issue was in the test - we were generating traffic on port 443 but filtering for port 8443
- The BPF debug output showed that packets with non-target ports were correctly being rejected

**Fix Verification**:
- Created proper tests that use port 443 for both filtering and traffic generation
- Verified that port filtering works correctly:
  - Traffic on target port (443) is captured
  - Traffic on non-target ports (80) is filtered out

### 2. HTTPS Decryption Issue ⏳ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
**Problem**: HTTPS packets are not being decoded to plaintext HTTP content due to missing SSL keylog file.

**Analysis**:
- The SSLKEYLOGFILE monitoring functionality is implemented and working
- The tool can read and parse SSLKEYLOGFILE entries
- However, the actual SSL key extraction from running applications is not fully implemented
- The current implementation has placeholders for eBPF uprobe attachment to SSL functions, but they're not fully implemented

**What's Working**:
✅ SSLKEYLOGFILE monitoring and parsing
✅ Reading existing SSL keys from SSLKEYLOGFILE
✅ Storing SSL keys in BPF maps
✅ TLS packet capture and filtering
✅ TLS record parsing

**What's Missing**:
❌ Actual eBPF uprobe attachment to SSL_write/SSL_read functions
❌ Real-time SSL key extraction from running applications
❌ Integration with applications that export keys via SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable

## Implementation Status

### Core Functionality ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ BPF program compilation and loading
2. ✅ XDP program attachment to network interfaces
3. ✅ TLS packet filtering and capture
4. ✅ Flow tracking using BPF maps
5. ✅ Basic packet parsing and validation
6. ✅ Ring buffer data transfer to userspace
7. ✅ Signal handling for graceful shutdown
8. ✅ Command-line argument parsing
9. ✅ Port filtering mechanism
10. ✅ SSLKEYLOGFILE monitoring and parsing

### SSL Key Extraction ⏳ PARTIAL
1. ✅ SSLKEYLOGFILE file monitoring and parsing
2. ✅ Storage of SSL keys in BPF maps
3. ❌ eBPF uprobe attachment to SSL functions (placeholder implementation)
4. ❌ Real-time key extraction from running applications

### Packet Decryption ⏳ PARTIAL
1. ✅ TLS record parsing
2. ✅ Basic decryption framework
3. ✅ Key lookup from BPF maps
4. ⏳ Actual decryption implementation (needs real keys)

## Recommendations for Full Implementation

### 1. Complete eBPF Uprobe Implementation
To fully implement SSL key extraction, the following steps are needed:

1. **Implement eBPF uprobe attachment to SSL functions**:
   - `SSL_write` - to capture outgoing TLS records
   - `SSL_read` - to capture incoming TLS records
   - `SSL_do_handshake` - to capture key material during handshake

2. **Enhance SSL key extraction**:
   - Extract master secret, client random, server random
   - Extract cipher suite information
   - Associate keys with specific network flows

3. **Improve key storage**:
   - Better flow key association
   - Multiple key support per connection
   - Key expiration and cleanup

### 2. Enhanced Decryption Capabilities
1. **Implement full TLS 1.2/1.3 decryption**:
   - AES-GCM, AES-CBC, ChaCha20-Poly1305
   - Proper key derivation functions
   - Support for different cipher suites

2. **HTTP content parsing**:
   - Better HTTP request/response detection
   - Header and body separation
   - Content-type handling

### 3. Integration Improvements
1. **Better SSLKEYLOGFILE integration**:
   - Real-time monitoring of file changes
   - Support for multiple concurrent applications
   - Key association with specific connections

2. **Enhanced command-line options**:
   - More flexible filtering options
   - Better output formatting
   - Export capabilities (JSON, PCAP with decrypted content)

## Current Usage

The tool currently works for:
1. Capturing TLS traffic on specific ports
2. Filtering traffic based on port
3. Parsing TLS records
4. Monitoring SSLKEYLOGFILE for pre-existing keys
5. Basic packet analysis

To use the tool effectively:
```bash
# Basic usage - capture HTTPS traffic on port 443
sudo ./tls_capture -i eth0 -P 443

# With SSLKEYLOGFILE for decryption (if you have keys)
SSLKEYLOGFILE=/tmp/sslkeys.txt sudo ./tls_capture -i eth0 -P 443

# Save captured packets to PCAP file
sudo ./tls_capture -i eth0 -P 443 -w capture.pcap
```

## Conclusion

The TLS capture tool has a solid foundation with working core functionality. The main issues identified have been addressed:

1. **Port filtering is working correctly** - verified through testing
2. **SSLKEYLOGFILE monitoring is implemented** - can read and parse key files

The remaining work is to fully implement the eBPF uprobe attachment for real-time SSL key extraction from running applications. This would require:

1. Completing the uprobe attachment functions in `src/ssl_hooks.c`
2. Implementing proper SSL key extraction from the hooked functions
3. Ensuring proper integration with applications that support SSLKEYLOGFILE

With these enhancements, the tool would be able to:
- Capture TLS traffic in real-time
- Extract encryption keys from running applications
- Decrypt TLS packets to plaintext HTTP content
- Display human-readable HTTP traffic
