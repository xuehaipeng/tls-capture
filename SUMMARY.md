# TLS Traffic Capture Tool - Progress Summary

## What Has Been Accomplished

### 1. Basic Tool Framework
- ✅ Created a working userspace application (`tls_capture`)
- ✅ Implemented command-line argument parsing
- ✅ Added signal handling for graceful shutdown
- ✅ Integrated with libbpf for BPF program loading
- ✅ Implemented XDP program attachment/detachment

### 2. BPF Program Infrastructure
- ✅ Created a minimal BPF program that compiles and loads
- ✅ Implemented basic XDP packet processing (currently passes all packets)
- ✅ Defined data structures for flow tracking and SSL key storage
- ✅ Set up framework for map definitions (flow_map, key_map, packet_ringbuf)

### 3. Build System
- ✅ Created Makefile for building both BPF and userspace components
- ✅ Implemented dependency checking
- ✅ Added cross-compilation support for ARM64 targets

### 4. Remote Deployment
- ✅ Set up remote build and deployment scripts
- ✅ Verified tool runs correctly on ARM64 Linux target

## Current Status

The tool is currently functional but minimal:
- Loads and attaches BPF programs to network interfaces
- Runs in passive mode (no packet capture or analysis yet)
- Provides basic framework for future enhancements

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Enhanced BPF Packet Capture
- [ ] Implement actual TLS packet filtering in XDP program
- [ ] Add proper map definitions for flow tracking
- [ ] Implement ring buffer for packet data transfer to userspace
- [ ] Add TLS record parsing and validation

### 2. SSL Key Extraction
- [ ] Implement uprobe-based SSL library hooking
- [ ] Add support for OpenSSL key extraction
- [ ] Implement key storage in BPF maps
- [ ] Add support for multiple SSL libraries (GnuTLS, NSS)

### 3. Packet Decryption
- [ ] Implement TLS 1.2/1.3 decryption algorithms
- [ ] Add key derivation functions
- [ ] Implement AES-GCM/ChaCha20-Poly1305 decryption
- [ ] Add packet reassembly for fragmented TLS records

### 4. Userspace Processing
- [ ] Implement ring buffer polling for packet reception
- [ ] Add packet analysis and decryption
- [ ] Implement output formatting (plaintext, JSON, PCAP)
- [ ] Add filtering and search capabilities

### 5. Advanced Features
- [ ] Add support for multiple network interfaces
- [ ] Implement process-specific SSL key targeting
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and statistics
- [ ] Implement configuration file support

## Technical Challenges Addressed

### 1. Cross-Platform Compilation
- Successfully resolved ARM64 cross-compilation issues
- Fixed BPF program loading and attachment problems
- Handled library dependencies appropriately

### 2. BPF Program Complexity
- Simplified BPF program to ensure basic functionality
- Created framework for adding advanced features incrementally
- Resolved map definition and ring buffer integration issues

### 3. Signal Handling and Cleanup
- Implemented proper signal handlers for graceful shutdown
- Added resource cleanup for BPF programs and maps
- Ensured no resource leaks on exit

## Testing and Validation

The tool has been tested and verified to:
- Compile successfully on ARM64 Linux targets
- Load and attach BPF programs to network interfaces
- Run without crashing or leaking resources
- Handle signals properly for clean shutdown

## Conclusion

We have successfully established the foundation for a TLS traffic capture and decryption tool using eBPF technology. The current implementation provides a solid base that can be extended with the advanced features outlined above to create a fully functional TLS analysis tool.

The next phase of development should focus on implementing the core packet capture and SSL key extraction functionality, followed by the decryption and analysis components.
