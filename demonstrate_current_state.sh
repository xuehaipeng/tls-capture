echo "=== Current State Summary ==="
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ What's Working:"
echo "  - BPF program loading and attachment to network interfaces"
echo "  - Basic XDP packet processing (currently passes all packets)"
echo "  - Framework for map definitions (flow_map, key_map, packet_ringbuf)"
echo "  - Signal handling for graceful shutdown"
echo "  - Command-line argument parsing"
echo ""
echo "‚ùå What's Not Implemented Yet:"
echo "  - Actual TLS packet filtering in XDP program"
echo "  - SSL key extraction mechanisms"
echo "  - Packet decryption algorithms"
echo "  - Ring buffer data transfer to userspace"
echo "  - SSL library hooking (OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS)"
echo ""
echo "üìù Next Steps for Full Implementation:"
echo "  1. Implement actual TLS packet filtering in XDP program"
echo "  2. Add SSL key extraction mechanisms"
echo "  3. Implement packet decryption algorithms"
echo "  4. Add userspace packet analysis and output formatting"

echo "The tool is currently functional but minimal - it provides a solid"
echo "foundation that can be extended to create a fully functional TLS"
echo "traffic capture and decryption tool."
