   - Identifies different record types (Handshake, Application Data, etc.)
   - Supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3 version detection

2. **Cryptographic Operations**
   - SSL/TLS key material simulation
   - HMAC-based key derivation
   - Simulated AES decryption processes

3. **Traffic Analysis**
   - Real-time packet analysis simulation
   - HTTP/HTTPS content detection
   - Structured output with hex dumps

4. **‚úÖ BPF Program Loading and XDP Attachment**
   - ‚úÖ Successful BPF program compilation
   - ‚úÖ XDP program attachment to network interfaces
   - ‚úÖ TLS packet filtering and capture
   - ‚úÖ Flow tracking using BPF maps
   - ‚úÖ Ring buffer data transfer to userspace

5. **Security Framework**
   - OpenSSL integration
   - Proper key handling and memory management
   - Cryptographically sound operations

### üöß Advanced Features (Framework Ready)
1. **eBPF Integration** - ‚úÖ BPF program loading working, needs key extraction
2. **Live Packet Capture** - ‚úÖ Framework exists with XDP, needs libpcap completion
3. **Real SSL Hooking** - Architecture designed, requires uprobe implementation

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Successful MVP Demonstration

2. Analyzing TLS Application Data Record:
TLS Record Analysis:
  Type: Application Data (0x17)
  Version: TLS 1.2 (0x0303)
