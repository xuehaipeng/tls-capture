- Minimal performance impact on system
- User-friendly interface for traffic analysis

## ✅ Current Status

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### 1.1 eBPF Programs

#### 1.2 Userspace Components
- **Control Application**: Main orchestration and UI
- **Key Management**: TLS key storage and lifecycle
- **Packet Processor**: Decryption and reassembly
- **Output Handler**: Plain text formatting and export

### 2. Implementation Strategy

#### 2.1 TLS Key Extraction Methods

**Method 1: SSL Library Hooking (Recommended)**
- Hook into OpenSSL/GnuTLS/NSS functions using eBPF uprobes
- Extract master secrets and session keys
- Target functions:
  - `SSL_write()` / `SSL_read()`
  - `SSL_get_session()`
  - Key derivation functions

**Method 2: Memory Scanning**
- Scan process memory for TLS key patterns
- Less reliable but works with statically linked applications
- Requires elevated privileges

**Method 3: SSLKEYLOGFILE Integration**
- Support for applications that export keys via SSLKEYLOGFILE
- Parse and utilize pre-exported key material
